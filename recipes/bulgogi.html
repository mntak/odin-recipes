    <h1>Beef Bulgogi (Korean BBQ Beef)</h1>
    <img src="/odin-recipes/images/bulgogi.jpg" />
    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      As a native Korean, I have eaten beef bulgogi all my life. When the thinly
      sliced beef marinated in a flavorful bulgogi sauce hits a very hot skillet
      or griddle on an open flame, it reminds you the smell of your favorite
      Korean BBQ restaurant. I have never met anyone who would not like Korean
      beef. Who can refuse the tender flavorful beef in a savory sauce? It is a
      killer dish to serve with rice. Whether you serve it as a signature main
      dish or as a simple Korean beef bowl, it’s all Korean heaven!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Thinly sliced beef sirloin, ribeye or flake steak</li>
      <li>Asian pear</li>
      <li>Kiwi</li>
      <li>Onion</li>
      <li>Garlic</li>
      <li>Soy Sauce</li>
      <li>Korean Soup Soy Sauce</li>
      <li>Rice Wine</li>
      <li>Brown Sugar</li>
      <li>Sesame Oil</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Put diced pear, kiwi, onion and garlic in a blender and process until
        very smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the onion/fruit puree into a large shallow pan – a 9×13-inch Pyrex
        baking pan (with a lid) is perfect for this.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add soy sauce, tuna sauce (or soup soy sauce), rice wine, Korean plum
        extract (if using), brown sugar, pepper and sesame oil; mix well.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can make this marinade sauce ahead of time and keep it in the
        refrigerator for up to 1 week.
      </li>
      <li>
        Separate the beef slices and add them to the marinade sauce. Toss gently
        by hand to combine everything with a slight massaging motion. Cover and
        marinate for at least 1 hour or up to overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a skillet very hot over high heat. Do Not Add any vegetable oil!
        Add the beef. You can add sliced Asian leek on top as I did, or onion or
        green onion.
      </li>
      <li>
        The beef should sizzle as soon as it touches the hot skillet. Let the
        meat cook in its own juice. Toss the meat around to cook evenly and
        thoroughly, about 2-3 minutes. It should cook very quickly.
      </li>
      <li>Sprinkle with sesame seeds and green onion to garnish.</li>
    </ol>
